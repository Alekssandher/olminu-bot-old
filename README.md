### Why Olminu?
The bot is named after Olminu, a character from the manga *Drifters*. As a fan of the character, I chose to name the bot in her honor.

    - Check the `.env.example` file for the required variables.

> **Note**: For testing, create a dedicated Discord server. Use the `GUILD_ID` environment variable to restrict commands to that server.

## Running the Project

Run the main file using one of the commands below.  

```bash
npm run dev:nodemon   # Runs the project with nodemon
ts-node main.ts       # Executes the TypeScript file directly

## Registering Slash Commands
Registering commands is simple. Use the `register-commands.ts` script provided in the repository.
Commands can be registered globally or restricted to a specific guild.

```
// To register guild commands
ts-node utils/register-commands.ts guild
```
```

ts-node utils/register-commands.ts global
